It derives from Rich Warren’s MultiDocument example: Freelance Mad Science Labs - Blog - Syncing multiple Core Data documents using iCloud________________________CreditsWWDC 2013 Video - Session 207 [What’s New in Core Data and iCloud](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc/videos/index.php?id=207)See Drew McCormack's note: http://mentalfaculty.tumblr.com/post/25241910449/under-the-sheets-with-icloud-and-core-dataUnder the Sheets with iCloud and Core Data: Troubleshooting“Unfortunately, the most apt conclusion is probably that iCloud syncing of Core Data is not really ready for prime time, at least not for any app with a complex data model. If you have a simple model, and patience, it is doable, even if very few have achieved a shipping app at this point.”Drew’s observation was certainly true at the time—June 16, 2012. This MultiDocumentPlusUUID effort has had a rather long and tragic history; it seems to break spectacularly with major releases of iOS. Many Bothans died... With iOS 7, we’re in somewhat better shape. Perhaps we’ve achieved a plateau of stability in the Core Data Cloud-sync API.See Erica Sudun’s iOS 5 Developer’s Cookbook:http://books.google.com/books?id=YeHQzA6UrcEC&pg=PT1173&lpg=PT1173&dq=yorn+BOOL+ios&source=bl&ots=vynUYXoVpH&sig=PCjk79J9uGt0EHHNgNF28JpQ-HA&hl=en&sa=X&ei=euGFT6K2BY-s8ATBgvyXCA&ved=0CB4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=yorn%20BOOL%20ios&f=falseSee: David Trotzhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/18971389/proper-use-of-icloud-fallback-storeshttps://github.com/dtrotzjr/APManagedDocumentThis sample code includes Stav Ashuri’s UIBAlertView, Copyright (c) 2013.
